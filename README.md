# Clustering -K Means method and Silhouette Score 
The different types of clustering includes:
1. K Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. K Mode Clustering
4. DBScan Clustering â€” Density-Based Spatial Clustering

Among them, K-means is one of the most popular clustering algorithm. In this K clusters is created where data points in each of these K clusters are similar properties.

The idea is to create K clusters of data where data in each of the K clusters have greater similarity with other data in the same cluster
